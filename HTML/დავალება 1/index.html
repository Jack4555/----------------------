    <h1>Gorillaz</h1>
    <h5>Gorillaz are an English virtual band created in 1998 by musician Damon <br>
        Albarn and artist Jamie Hewlett. The band primarily consists of four animated  <br>
        members: 2-D, Murdoc Niccals, Noodle, and Russel Hobbs. Their fictional universe <br>
        is presented in music videos, interviews and short cartoons. In reality, Albarn is <br>
        the only permanent musical contributor, and Gorillaz' music often features collaborations <br>
        with a wide range of featured artists. Remi Kabaka Jr. became the producer for the band in<br>
        2016 after several years of providing the voice of Russel Hobbs and was listed as an official <br>
        member alongside Albarn and Hewlett in the 2019 documentary Gorillaz: Reject False Icons.[1]</h5>
