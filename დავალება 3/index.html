            <p class="content">
                The Montreux Jazz Festival opened on 18 June 1967 and was founded by Claude Nobs, Géo Voumard and René Langel with considerable help 
                from Ahmet and Nesuhi Ertegun of Atlantic Records. The festival was first held at Montreux Casino. The driving force is the tourism office 
                under the direction of Raymond Jaussi. It lasted for three days and featured almost exclusively jazz artists. The highlights of this era 
                were Charles Lloyd, Miles Davis, Keith Jarrett, Jack DeJohnette, Bill Evans, Soft Machine, Weather Report, The Fourth Way, Nina Simone,
                Jan Garbarek, and Ella Fitzgerald.

                Originally a pure jazz festival, it opened up in the 1970s and today presents artists of nearly every imaginable music style. 
                Jazz remains an important part of the festival. Part of the festival's expansion was due to coproduction by Quincy Jones who brought
                many international artists in the early 1990s. Today's festival lasts about two weeks and attracts an audience of more than 200,000 people.

                In the 1970s, the festival began broadening its scope, including blues, soul, and rock artists, for instance Marianne Faithfull,
                Led Zeppelin, Pink Floyd, Frank Zappa, Deep Purple, Canned Heat and many others. Towards the end of the decade, the festival
                expanded even more, including music from all continents (with an emphasis on Brazilian music) and lasting a full three weeks. 
                Santana came to Montreux for the first time in 1970; Van Morrison played in 1974 and 1980. Other artists included B.B. King, 
                Gary Moore, Weather Report, Don Ellis, Crossfire, Buddy Guy, Camarón de la Isla and Tomatito, Soft Machine, Chuck Berry,
